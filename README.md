# MeshParameterization

Parametrization is a key operation for texture mapping and surface coloring (e.g. putting a face picture on
mesh).
Given a surface mesh with boundary:
* Detect mesh boundary loops
* Perform a flattening of the mesh onto the plane while maintaining a low distortion.
* Visualize the flattened mesh using the normal of the original 3D mesh
